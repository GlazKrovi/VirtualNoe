4. upd inventoryController (and creature control, rm useless funct)
5. add drug class and logic
6. upd player
7. upd player control

- use directly interface into controllers instead of ID (laravel resolve/find automatically associated line in db)
- Add Drug
- update uml and add <<create>> and explicit attributes array for models

- no level for player, just for creature. the 'exp of player' will be the sum of all his creatures' exp
